abstract=<p>The University of Murcia signed on November 29, 2017, a Covenant with the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness backing the “HÉRCULES: Semantic University Research Data” Project with a budget of FIVE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED euros with an 80% of co-financiering from the European Regional Development Fund program (ERDF) within the 2014-2020 period.</p><p>The project arose as a CRUE initiative, to create the basis for a new collaboration model between universities, to develop the information management systems and with the main objective of encouraging this type of collaboration.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this agreement was to contribute to the improvement of public services and business innovation and research through the improvement of:</p><ul><li>efficiency in public investment by decreasing the duplication of investment in R&amp;D.</li><li>efficiency of research in universities.</li><li>scientific dissemination of research results.</li><li>detection of synergies in R&amp;D between universities.</li><li>transfer of R&amp;D results to companies.</li><li>efficiency in the management of research.</li><li>by creating a research management system with semantic capacities based on semantic open data and that will provide a global view of the research data contained in the Spanish University System.</li></ul><p>The Hercules Ontology Network (HON in English, ROH-Red de Ontologías Hércules in Spanish) defines the entities that conform a Knowledge Graph modelling information about the academic world. This network on ontologies reused correspond to a wide number of extensively used ontologies, e.g. BIBO, VIVO or SKOS, among others, and extends the imported entities with new entities and relationships to be able to represent knowledge in the academic domain in a comprehensive manner. The following listing enumerates the main entities reused and refined (those with a prefix not starting by “roh”) and those newly defined (starting by prefix roh”): vivo:AcademicDegree, roh:Accreditation, rohes:Account, roh:Activity, foaf:Agent, skos:Concept, roh:CurriculumVitae, roh:Expense, gn:Feature, roh:Funding, roh:Infrastructure, roh:Metric, vivo:Project, vivo:Relationship, roh:ResearchObject, obo-bfo:Role, obo-ero:Service, rohes:Tax, obo-bfo:TemporalRegion</p><p>This ontology has the following classes and properties.</p><p>A more in-depth explanation of the main entities in ROH and the relationship among them is given in ROH Tutorial. You should read this document to understand how academic knowledge is modelled in ROH  (<a href="https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoOnto/tree/master/Documentation">https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoOnto/tree/master/Documentation</a>).</p><p>On the other hand, the ROH Reference Specification (<a href="https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoOnto/blob/master/Documentation/1-%20OntologyDocumentation.pdf">https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoOnto/blob/master/Documentation/1-%20OntologyDocumentation.pdf</a>) offers an overview in tabular form for each of the entities, giving details on the object and data properties supported by each entity in ROH. This document is very useful when instances of ROH want to be created, since it clearly explains what entity types a given entity type relates with through an object property and what data properties are supported by a given entity type, including details about its associated object types.</p>
