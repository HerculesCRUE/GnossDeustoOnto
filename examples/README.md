# ROH ontology examples

In this folder different examples on how to use the ROH ontology can be found. The main file is data.ttl, where the following examples can be found:

* Universities and their associated Research Groups.
* Researchers associated to those Research Groups.
* Contracts and grants associated to researchers. 
* Supervised PhD theses.
* Conferences in which researchers have participated.
* Projects in which different research groups have collaborated with different companies and funded by different funding programs.
* Expenses associated to a project.
* Publications and patentes by different researchers.

Besides, there are some folders with small examples focused on modelling aspects such as list of authors in a publication or how to establish supervising relationships among supervisor, students and thesis. These examples where ellaborated to illustrate aspects considered complex when modelling some use cases in ROH validation. 

Notice that [data.ttl](https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoOnto/blob/master/examples/data.ttl) contains a complete although simple RDF graph modelling the concepts tried out during the [validation questions](https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/GnossDeustoBackend/tree/master/validation-questions) execution.
